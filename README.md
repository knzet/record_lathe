# record_lathe
diy lathe for plastic disk audio recordings


## goals
- cut acceptable quality recordings (can be lofi, not terribly so)
- repeatability, precision
- budget <$500
- diy as much as possible, off-the shelf when not possible
- crazy good documentation for nontechnical folks (musicians, producers)

## current progress
- linear actuator moves at the speed, pressure needed
- state machine lowers cutting head, runs cut, lifts head
- control panel

## roadmap to working lathe
- lights on control panel to get rid of serial prints
- spiral out
- create cutter head
  - experiment with styli, embossing vs. cutting
- experiment with plastics, heat lamp, heated stylus, solvents
